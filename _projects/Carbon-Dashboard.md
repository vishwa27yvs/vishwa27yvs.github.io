May 2020 - July 2020

I worked on the project Carbon Dashboard, which provides granular insights and analysis of carbon emissions across buildingsâ€”developed a Time Series Model using Machine Learning to predict the attendance of people, to allow better planning, reducing the wastage of resources and carbon emission. Used features like trend, seasonality and correlation for tuning the model. Tech stack used: PySpark, Python, SQL, Databricks, PowerBI and Azure services. I worked on this project during my internship at Microsoft. The project achieved 2nd place globally in the domain Hack for Sustainability at the Microsoft Global Hackathon 2020.
