title: "Modelling The Cognitive Functions of Consumer Behaviour "
permalink: /projects_new/ML-CogN
---

This project aims to predict consumer behaviour using brain wave measurement technology and machine learning. Processed the collected brain data‑EEG signals using MATLAB EEGlab toolkit. Developed a Machine Learning Model in Python to predict consumer behaviour using classification algorithms like K‑ Nearest Neighbors and
Random Forest on the processed EEG data. This project was done under the guidance of [Prof. Bharat Deshpande](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/bmd/profile), BITS Pilani, K K Birla Goa Campus. [GITHUB](https://github.com/vishwa27yvs/ML-and-Consumer-Neuroscience).
