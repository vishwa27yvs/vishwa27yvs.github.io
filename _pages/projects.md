## Carbon Dashboard 
May 2020 - July 2020

I worked on the project Carbon Dashboard, which provides granular insights and analysis of carbon emissions across buildings—developed a Time Series Model using Machine Learning to predict the attendance of people, to allow better planning, reducing the wastage of resources and carbon emission. Used features like trend, seasonality and correlation for tuning the model. Tech stack used: PySpark, Python, SQL, Databricks, PowerBI and Azure services. I worked on this project during my internship at Microsoft. 
The project achieved 2nd place globally in the domain Hack for Sustainability at the Microsoft Global Hackathon 2020.

## Machine Learning Algorithms for Structural Health Monitoring 
May 2020 - June 2020

Built deep learning models for Monitoring the Health of Building Structures which allows keeping track of structural damage using features like inter-story drift ratio and data from accelerometer signals. Used CNNs on simulated accelerometer data for classifying structural state based on damage. This can help address vulnerable structures and prevent the loss of life and property after a natural disaster. Worked on the project during my internship at CEERI Pilani.[GITHUB](https://github.com/vishwa27yvs/Structural-Health-Monitoring)

## Modelling The Cognitive Functions of Consumer Behaviour 
Jan 2020 - May 2020

This project aims to predict consumer behaviour using brain wave measurement technology and machine learning. Processed the collected brain data‑EEG signals using MATLAB EEGlab toolkit. Developed a Machine Learning Model in Python to predict consumer behaviour using classification algorithms like K‑ Nearest Neighbors and
Random Forest on the processed EEG data. This project was done under the guidance of [Prof. Bharat Deshpande](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/bmd/profile), BITS Pilani, K K Birla Goa Campus.[GITHUB](https://github.com/vishwa27yvs/ML-and-Consumer-Neuroscience).

## Markov Chain Model For Natural Language 
Jan 2019

Used a Markov Chain to create a probability distribution of each successive letter depending on the preceding letters for a piece of English text. Simulated Markov chain to generate pseudo‑random text in Java from this probabilistic distribution.[GITHUB](https://github.com/vishwa27yvs/Intro-to-Computer-Science-COS-126/tree/master/Markov%20Model)
