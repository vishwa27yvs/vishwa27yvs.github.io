I am a third-year undergraduate at [BITS Pilani, K K Birla Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/) pursuing Computer Science Engineering. I have mainly worked on projects related to Machine Learning Algorithms and its applications[(projects)](https://vishwa27yvs.github.io//projects/). I am also interested in Cognitive Neuroscience, Discrete Structures and Graph Theory.

Previously I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at [Microsoft India(R&D)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/msidc/) on the project Carbon Dashboard to build **Time Series Models using Machine Learning** for building sustainability solutions. During my research internship at [CSIR - Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute, Pilani](https://www.ceeri.res.in/), I worked on building Deep Learning Algorithms for **Structural Health Monitoring**.
