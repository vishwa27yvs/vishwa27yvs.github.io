I am a third-year undergratuate at [BITS Pilani, K K Birla Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/) pursuing Computer Science Engineering. My fields of interest mainly includes Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I am also interested in discrete structures and graph theory.

Previously I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at [Microsoft India(R&D)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/msidc/) where I worked on the project Carbon Dashboard to  build [Time Series Models using Machine Learning](https://vishwa27yvs.github.io//projects/) for building sustainability solutions. During my research internship at [CSIR - Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute, Pilani](https://www.ceeri.res.in/), I worked on building Deep Learning Algorithms for Health Monitoring of Building Structures.
